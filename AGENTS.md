# AI Agent Instructions

This document provides instructions for AI coding agents (Claude, GitHub Copilot, Cursor, etc.) working on this project.

---

## Project Overview

**Allo-Scrapper** is a cinema showtimes aggregator that:
- Scrapes movie screening schedules from external cinema websites
- Stores data in PostgreSQL
- Exposes a REST API (Express.js + TypeScript)
- Provides a React frontend

---

## MANDATORY Workflow

**You MUST follow this workflow for every task, in order:**

```
1. ISSUE   → Verify or create a GitHub issue
2. BRANCH  → Create a dedicated feature branch from develop for this issue
3. RED     → Write failing tests first (commit before implementing)
4. GREEN   → Write minimal code to make tests pass
5. DOCS    → Update README.md / AGENTS.md if API or behaviour changed
6. COMMIT  → Atomic commits with Conventional Commits format
7. PR      → Open Pull Request referencing the issue, wait for review
             → After merge: use cleanup skill or manually switch back to develop, pull latest
```

**Conditional steps (not always required):**
- **Docker build** — run `docker compose build` before pushing if Dockerfile or dependencies changed
- **E2E tests** — Playwright infrastructure exists (`e2e/`) but E2E tests are currently out of scope

---

## Step 1: Issue First

**CRITICAL: Every PR MUST be linked to an issue. No exceptions.**

Before writing any code:

1. **Create an issue** if none exists using the appropriate label:
   - `bug` — For bugs
   - `enhancement` — For new features
   - `documentation` — For docs/chores

```bash
# Create issue
gh issue create --title "feat: description" --body "Details..." --label enhancement
gh issue create --title "fix: description" --body "Details..." --label bug
gh issue create --title "docs: description" --body "Details..." --label documentation
```

**Note the issue number** — you will need it for the branch name, commits, and PR.

---

## Step 2: Branch

**One branch per issue. No exceptions.**

```bash
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
git checkout -b feature/<issue-number>-<short-description>
```

**Examples:**
- `feature/259-add-cinema-modal`
- `feature/42-fix-parser-bug`
- `feature/266-optimize-agents-md`

**Rules:**
- Always branch from `develop`, never from `main` or another feature branch
- One issue = one branch = one PR
- NEVER push directly to `develop` or `main`

---

## Step 3: RED — Write Failing Tests First

**CRITICAL: Write tests BEFORE implementation.**

Write the test, run it, confirm it fails, then commit:

```bash
cd server
npm run test:run   # confirm test fails (RED)

git commit -m "test(scope): add test for <feature>"
```

### Test Commands

```bash
cd server

# Watch mode (recommended during development)
npm test

# Single run
npm run test:run

# Single file
npx vitest run src/utils/url.test.ts

# With coverage report
npm run test:coverage
```

For scraper microservice tests:

```bash
cd scraper

# Watch mode
npm test

# Single run
npm run test:run
```

### Coverage Targets

- Lines: >= 80%
- Functions: >= 80%
- Statements: >= 80%
- Branches: >= 65%

### Test File Locations

```
scraper/src/scraper/theater-parser.test.ts  # Parser tests (scraper microservice)
server/src/utils/date.test.ts               # Server utility tests
server/src/utils/url.test.ts                # URL utility tests
scraper/tests/unit/                         # Scraper unit tests
```

### Adding Test Fixtures

For scraper parser tests, use real HTML fixtures in the scraper package:

```bash
curl "https://www.allocine.fr/seance/salle_gen_csalle=CXXXX.html" \
  -o scraper/tests/fixtures/cinema-cxxxx-page.html
```

---

## Step 4: GREEN — Implement

After the failing test is committed:

1. Write **minimal code** to pass the failing tests
2. Run tests frequently: `npm test`
3. Ensure all tests pass before committing

```bash
cd server && npm run test:run   # all green
```

---

## Step 5: DOCS — Update Documentation

Before committing, update documentation if any of the following changed:

- **Public API** — new or modified endpoints → update `README.md` API section
- **Behaviour change** — changed defaults, config, env vars → update `README.md`
- **Agent workflow** — new gotchas, lessons learned, or workflow changes → update `AGENTS.md`
- **White-label / settings schema** — update `WHITE-LABEL.md`

If nothing changed for external consumers or future agents, skip this step.

---

## Step 6: Atomic Commits

**Each commit = one logical, self-contained change.**

### Conventional Commits Format

```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer: refs #123]
```

### Commit Types

| Type | Use Case |
|------|----------|
| `feat` | New feature |
| `fix` | Bug fix |
| `docs` | Documentation only |
| `test` | Adding/updating tests |
| `chore` | Maintenance (deps, config) |
| `refactor` | Code refactoring |
| `style` | Formatting changes |
| `perf` | Performance improvement |
| `ci` | CI/CD changes |
| `build` | Build system changes |

### Scopes

| Scope | Area |
|-------|------|
| `scraper` | Scraping service |
| `api` | REST API |
| `db` | Database |
| `parser` | HTML parsing |
| `client` | React frontend |
| `docker` | Docker/deployment |
| `observability` | Logging, metrics, tracing |

### Commit Order

For a typical feature:

```bash
git commit -m "test(scope): add test for <feature>"       # RED — always first
git commit -m "feat(scope): implement <feature>

refs #<issue>"                                             # GREEN
git commit -m "docs: update README with <feature>"        # DOCS — if applicable
```

---

## Step 7: Pull Request

```bash
# Push branch
git push -u origin feature/<issue-number>-<short-description>

# Create PR
gh pr create --title "feat(scope): description" --body "## Summary
- Change 1
- Change 2

Closes #<issue-number>"
```

**Before requesting review:**
- [ ] All tests pass (`npm run test:run`)
- [ ] Code coverage maintained
- [ ] Conventional Commits used
- [ ] Documentation updated (if applicable)
- [ ] Issue referenced in PR body

**After merge:**

Use the cleanup skill for automated post-merge cleanup:
```

## Useful Commands

### Setup (run once after cloning)

```bash
# Install git hooks (pre-push: tsc + tests)
./scripts/install-hooks.sh

# Install dependencies (CRITICAL: run from server/ directory)
cd server && npm install

# Install client dependencies
cd ../client && npm install
```

**⚠️ Always run `npm install` from `server/` directory, not root.** See "Native Dependencies" gotcha below.

### Development

```bash
# Start dev environment
npm run dev

# Run server tests
cd server && npm test

# Single test file
cd server && npx vitest run src/services/scraper/theater-parser.test.ts

# Check test coverage
cd server && npm run test:coverage

# Manual pre-push check (same as the hook)
cd server && npx tsc --noEmit && npm run test:run

# Run scraper microservice tests
cd scraper && npm test
```

## Important Reminders

1. **NEVER skip tests** — TDD is mandatory; write tests before code
2. **NEVER mix unrelated changes** in one commit
3. **ALWAYS create one branch per issue** — feature branches from `develop` only
4. **ALWAYS reference issues** in commits and PRs
5. **ALWAYS update docs** when changing public APIs
6. **NEVER push directly to `develop` or `main`** — always use a feature branch and PR

## Questions?

If unclear about requirements:
1. Check existing code patterns in the relevant directory
2. Check `server/tests/README.md` for testing specifics
3. Ask for clarification before proceeding
